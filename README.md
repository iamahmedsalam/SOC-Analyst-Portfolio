# SOC Analyst Portfolio - Ahmed Salam

Building hands-on cybersecurity skills with CompTIA Security+ as my foundation — this portfolio features a multi-agent Wazuh SOC lab and projects demonstrating real-world SOC Analyst capabilities.

## Phase 1-3: Home SOC Lab with Wazuh

- **Goal**: Built a mini-SOC from scratch using VirtualBox.
- **Tech**: Ubuntu Server for Wazuh SIEM, Windows 11 endpoint with Sysmon, multi-agent monitoring.
- **Outcomes**: Dashboard live on HTTP 5601, internal manager agent (ID 000), Windows agent enrolled, events from Sysmon (process creation, file changes).

Challenges solved: Config validation, port binding, SSL to HTTP fallback, agent enrollment.

Next: Core SOC simulations (brute-force detection, phishing response, etc.).
